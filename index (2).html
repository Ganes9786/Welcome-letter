I wanted to let you know just how much I need you right now. Honestly, I miss your touch more than words can say. Each day feels like I'm missing a part of myself, and every minute apart from you makes me realize just how much your presence means to me.
avaN meethu Aval konda vannam , azhagin arthama iruku.Already sonnathu pola, ivan ninaipathai vida athigam "Desire is her way".
Ivan 

Avan nambikai ,She's come back to him.Aval illatha idamum illa irupathil replace'um illa.Yevlo pidichuruku nu sonnalum avan meethu aval vaithirupatha vida kammi thaan pola I agreed......Athugaha avaney way of interest little drop kooda kaanom pogala

I've been feeling so guilty about that day. Varthai pothathu express how sorry I am. Yellaam Ivan wanted to do is hug you tightly and tell you not to say leave Apdi pesatha , because I need you more than you know.

You'r Thimirupidichavan,
Kannama !`);
